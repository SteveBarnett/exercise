# TODO

If I spent more time on this, I would have looked at:

- checking my `git status -s` more carefully! (There's one `TODO` left)
- moving colour-related styles out of `_layout.scss`
- variable-ising more things for reusability
- adding a more verbose Issue to Feature Branch to Pull Request example
- splitting it across a few commits: initial HTML just boxes and headers; adding the form; adding style.scss; adding colours, spacing, typography; adding layout.
